/**
 * Proxy object for a tv channel, with options to provide a name, icon/symbol, and channel number.
 * Number is almost certainly based on particular user details, as channels can have different
 * mappings through different providers and in different areas.
 * <p/>
 * TvChannel objects do not themselves contain more data, at least on the client, as there could be
 * a very large amount of data that would need to either be included, or not. As such, showtimes and
 * shows are made available through different requests, and possibly should be cached on the client.
